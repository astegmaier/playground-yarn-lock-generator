# playground-yarn-lock-generator

This repo contains a bunch of separate test projects that we can use to generate yarn berry (version 2+) `yarn.lock` files for various scenarios.

This is useful in cases where you need to parse the lockfile, and want a bunch of real-world examples to test against.
